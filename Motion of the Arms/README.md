# Motion of the Arms

Photographic evidence has shown that the golfer's arms and the golf club follow non-planar motion during the downswing.  However, most models of the golf swing assume that the golfer's arm plane is constant throughout the downswing.
We investigate the downswing of PGA Tour Rory McIlroy to determine whether this approximation of a constant arm plane angle is acceptable.
