# Double-Pendulum-Golf-Swing-Models
This repository contains the Python scripts used to investigate "Maximizing the Swing Speed at Impact of Double Pendulum Models of the Golf Swing".  This work was conducted by and is intellectual property of Tucker Knaak in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of M.S. Physics in the Creighton Unviersity Department of Physics.

In an ideal world, we can model the golf swing as a double pendulum constrained to swing in a plane.  These two pendula represent the golfer's arms and the golf club, and we can utilize Lagrangian mechanics to derive and to study the equations of motion governing this system.  From photographic evidence, we find the golfer's body shifts horizontally and vertically and that the golf club follows non-planar motion distinct from the golfer's arms during the downswing.  This led us to derive a new 3D Non-Planar model of the golf swing which better matches the swings of real golfers, particularly highly-skilled golfers.  These models were then used to determine how golfers use different swing mechanics to maximize the swing speed at impact.
