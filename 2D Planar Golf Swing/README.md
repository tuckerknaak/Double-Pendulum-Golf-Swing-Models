# 2D Planar Golf Swing

We model the golf swing with a double pendulum system representing the golfer's arms and the golf club which are constrained to swing in a single plane.  We used Lagrangian mechanics to derive the equations of motion governing this system.
We then varied parameters of the golfer and initial conditions in an attempt to maximize the golfer's swing speed at impact.
