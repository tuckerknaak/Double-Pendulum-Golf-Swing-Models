# Numerical Methods

We know from classical mechanics that the total energy of the system is conserved if the Lagrangian is implicit with respect to time.  The total energy of the double pendulum golf swing models is proportional to the swing speed of each model.
multiple numerical methods in an attempt to find the algorithm which best conserves the total energy of the system and matches the theoretical results.  We derived the 4th-Order Yoshida algorithm and found that this algorithm performed the best
at conservering the total energy of the system between the numerical methods tested.
