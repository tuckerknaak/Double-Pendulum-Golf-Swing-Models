# 3D Non-Planar Golf Swing

We model the golf swing with a double pendulum system representing the golfer's arms and the golf club.  We constrained the golfer's arms to a plane rotated about the x-axis but allowed the golf club to swing in a non-planar motion distinct
from the golfer's arm plane.  We used Lagrangian mechanics to derive the equations of motion governing this system and included both a constant hub and an accelerating hub model.  We then varied parameters of the golfer and initial conditions
in an attempt to maximize the golfer's swing speed at impact.
